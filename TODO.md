# TODO: Add Delete Option to Deal Cards

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Modify DealCard.tsx to add a delete button (using Trash icon) next to the existing info button in the card header. The delete button will call onDelete(deal) with event stopPropagation to prevent card click.
- [x] Test the delete functionality after changes.
